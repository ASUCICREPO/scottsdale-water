1  Introduction

This document explains how eCognition was used to
automate landscape classification and provides the script needed to do this.

2 eCognition

eCognition makes a radical departure from conventional
approaches to data analysis due to its ability to emulate the human mind's
cognitive powers and fuse geospatial input data. Using patented segmentation
and classification processes, eCognition developed a robust method of rendering
knowledge in a semantic network. The technology examines pixels/ points not in
isolation, but in context. It builds up a picture iteratively, recognizing
groups of pixels as objects. Just like the human mind, it uses the color,
shape, texture and size of objects as well as their context and relationships
to draw the same conclusions and inferences as an experienced analyst, but
adding the advantages of automation and standardization. Though somewhat
simplified, the following example illustrates the basic principles.

3 What is needed to run the script?

The following things are needed to run the script in
Ecognition.

1.    Red Green Blue (RGB) image
2.    LIDAR Data (Light Detection and Ranging) (See appendix for point clouds)
3.    Infrared

Load the following datasets into Ecognition and run the
script. It will output the surface area of the different types of landscapes.

4 Results from running the script

This shows an example output from a randomly ingested
dataset.
